# React Hooks w/ Next.js

## Why?

- So I could reinforce what I learn about hooks w/ an actual API. I also wanted to see how they play w/ the Next.js framework.

## Setup

- To run this locally you'll need to run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`.
- You'll also **need to add a `.env` file** with the following variables:
  - LOG_API: true | false
  - LOG_INIT_PROPS: true | false
  - MARVEL_API_KEY: (Get this from https://developer.marvel.com/signup)
